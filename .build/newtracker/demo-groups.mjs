/* demo-groups.mjs – the groups "The vote by age, gender and education" pools
   across pollsters (gen-data §7g), and each house's own groups mapped onto
   them. Pure; pinned by .build/test-crosstabs.mjs.

   A house's group joins a common one only where it is the same people:
     gender      Men, Women – every house.
     age         18–34 – Resolve, DemosAU and YouGov all cut there. 35–54 and
                 55+ – Resolve and DemosAU. YouGov's 35–49 and 50+ (earlier
                 50–64 and 65+) hold other people, so they don't join.
     generation  Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers – YouGov and RedBridge.
                 YouGov's Silent generation (RedBridge prints none) doesn't.
     education   three levels of highest qualification. DemosAU's School,
                 YouGov's Year 12 or less, and RedBridge's Below Year 12 and
                 Year 12 together are Year 12 or less; TAFE, TAFE or college
                 and TAFE or trade are TAFE or trade; University is University.
                 RedBridge's two school rows merge 39:61, the split of its own
                 printed group sizes (Jul–Aug 2026: 216 and 343 respondents;
                 its earlier reports print none). */
